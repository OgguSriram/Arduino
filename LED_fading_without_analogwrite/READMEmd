# LED Fading Without analogWrite ðŸŒ—âœ¨

This project demonstrates how to fade an LED in and out using **manual PWM** with an Arduino â€” without using the built-in `analogWrite()` function.

---

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

- Smoothly fades an LED from OFF to ON and back
- Uses software-based PWM using `digitalWrite()` and `delayMicroseconds()`
- Great for learning about timing and brightness control without hardware PWM

```cpp
int led = 9;
int brightness = 0;
int fadeAmount = 5;

void setup() {
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 255; i++) {
    if (i < brightness) {
      digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
    } else {
      digitalWrite(led, LOW);
    }
    delayMicroseconds(100);
  }
  
  Serial.println(brightness);
  
  brightness += fadeAmount;
  
  if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;
  }
  
  delay(10); //slow down fading
}
